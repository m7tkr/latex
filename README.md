# latex

## bold words

* preabmle vs environment
* command, macro and declaration
* switching command vs argument
* group syntax

## syntax

* `\textbackslash` vs `\\`
* `newcommnad{command}[arg][optional]{definition}`
* `~` - prohibits line, like in `Dr. ~Watson`

## notes

* `kpsewhich {package name}.sty` - check if package is installed
* `tlmgr` - tex package manager

> Change the font shape sensibly.
> Combining font shapes, such as marking bold and italic at the same time, might be considered a questionable style choice. Change the font shape wiselyâ€”and consistently.
